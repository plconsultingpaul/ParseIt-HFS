If no COD record exists for the order, the API will create it.\n\nThe estimatedDeliveryDate will be updated based on the following app config option:\n\n* CSERVE.EXE > Reset Estimated Delivery Date Value When Delivery Date of Freight Bill Changed\n\nThe billToCode can only be updated using the billTo override (R) option.\n\nThe interliner (I) option for billTo can only be used if there is at least one interliner record with that has a receivable chargesType option set.\n\nDuplicate PO is not allowed on traceNumber for the same billTo when the app config option CSERV.EXE > Check PO is set.\n\nOrders and rate quotes can be viewed in the Customer Service application.\n\nPickup requests can be viewed in the Order Preprocessor application.\n\nCOD records can be viewed in the Customer Service application > COD tab.",
